  title: "Better hints for the Docker challenge"
  type: "improvement"
  description_md: |
    Based on feedback from early access users, the hints for the Docker
    challenge have been updated. 

    - The base URL for [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)'s public [registry
      API](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/) is surprisingly hard to
      find, it isn't mentioned in any official documentation. This is now
      included in the hints for the last stage.

    - A hint to use
      [`docker-explorer`](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/docker-explorer)'s
      commands like `echo` & `echo_stderr` was placed in the "Exit Codes" stage
      instead of "Wireup stdout & stderr". It is now back where it belongs.

    - Added a note that [Official
      images](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/official_images/) need to be
      prepended with `library/` when interacting with the registry API.

    If you've completed one or more challenges, you now have a swanky new
    profile page!

    Visit https://codecrafters.io/users/\<your_github_username\> to see yours.

    Unlike early access trials, the data stored here is persistent. For now,
    activity is synced once a day. This'll be more real-time in the future.

  description_md: |
    In some challenges, depending on the language you're using, you might
    receive language-specific hints.

    <img class="changelog-preview" src="/images/language-hints.png">

    The language you attempt a challenge in a huge part of the experience. There
    are often quirks to watch out for. Some have a better standard library than
    others. Hopefully this'll make the experience a bit more delightful,
    especially if you're new to a language!

    Our third challenge will be [Build your own Git](/challenges/git).

    In this challenge, you'll build a toy Git implementation that can clone a
    public repository, commit changes and push them back to a git server. Along
    the way, you'll learn about the [.git
    directory](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/03/23/whats-inside-your-git-directory.html),
    a few of Git's ["plumbing"
    commands](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain),
    [Git objects](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects)
    (blobs, commits, trees etc.), [Git transfer
    protocols](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-The-Protocols) and
    more.

    [Early access](/early-access) trials will start for this challenge will start soon.

    Earlier, users advanced from one stage to the next by manually updating the
    `current_stage` value in `codecrafters.yml` and pushing a commit.

    This is no longer required, the test runner & UI both automatically figure
    out which stage you're attempting and act accordingly.

    this flow!

    In this challenge, you'll build a toy Docker implementation that can pull
    an image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) and execute commands
    in it. Along the way, you'll learn about
    [chroot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot), [kernel

  title: "Redis: Better signal handling"
  type: "improvement"
  description_md: |
    In the [Redis challenge](/challenges/redis), we weren't properly
    forwarding signals to the child process when it was being terminated. This
    resulted in multiple versions of the same program running, which caused
    failures to bind to a port for subsequent runs of the program.

    This has now been fixed. Thanks to [@Gufran](https://github.com/Gufran)
    for pointing this out!

    Announcing our first challenge: [Build Your Own Redis](/challenges/redis).

    In this challenge, you‚Äôll build an application that can speak the Redis
    protocol, and is capable of serving basic commands like `PING`, `ECHO`,
    `SET` and `GET`. Along the way, you‚Äôll learn about TCP servers, event
    loops and more.

    We'll launch an early access program soon so that you can try this out.
